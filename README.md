# css-hover-effects
Collection of CSS hover effects.


This Repository is a collection of hover effects, transitions, and animations entirely coded in css.
One can find much prevalent effects to rarely used effects over here. As it is a collection of effects,
I have derived inspiration from various sources, like 'simple transitions' are from @IanLunn's collections.
Although I have derived the inspiration from various sources, but I have coded all the effects entirely by myself.

Everyone is free to use these effects in their eprojects.

<b>How to use the effects:</b><br/>
If you want to use many effects in a single project, then copy 'hover.css' file to your project, and then add the relevant '.class-name' to the element. If you want to add only one effect, it is better to copy the relevant css class code to your style sheet, instead of copying entire hover.css file.<br />

Project is still in progress. Many other effects will be added soon.
